# HCKB
Handwired, 3D printed clone of HHKB.
## The story behind
Realizing that I bit off more than I could chew with the [Kaiju75](https://github.com/sch3fr/Kaiju75) project, which I 
haven't touched in months because I feel overwhelemed whenever I think about it, I decided to start with something simpler.
<br>
Happy Clone Keyboard is, as the name suggests, a clone of the famous HHKB. 
<br>
I am fascinated with the HHKB layout and history, but as a college student I can not afford to drop such money for a 
keyboard I am not sure I'd use. Since, you know, the whole weird layout and stuff. So I decided to design my own clone
of it for cheaper. I am making yet another HHKB clone, since I am not satisfied with the available keyboards. Most of 
downloadable keebs are just cases without a plate, or are weird in some way. Also, I found I have no keycap set with 6U 
spacebar, so I'm modifying it for 6.25U one.
## Needed hardware so far
- Pro Micro
- 60 Cherry MX compatible keyboard switches
- Cherry style plate mounted stabs
- 3D printer with some filament; I'm using PLA
### Will specify later
- +- 60 diodes
- M3 screws
## Plans for this repo
- [ ] fix readme
- [ ] Design the keyboard in OpenSCAD
- [ ] Print it
- [ ] Wire it
- [ ] Write QMK firmware
- [ ] Edit the firmware for use with Vial
